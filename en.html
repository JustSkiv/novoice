    <h1>Please Do Not Send Voice Messages!</h1>
    <div class="meta-question">
        <div>Sending voice messages without a good reason is disrespectful to the recipient.</div>

        <h2>Why:</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <div>1. They are harder to understand <span class="toggle" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">more</span></div>
            <div class="details">
                We do not always perceive information immediately and at first glance. In the case of a text message, it
                is quite easy to re-read it completely or partially. Voice messages usually have to be listened to in
                full: this is very inconvenient and takes a lot of time.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div>2. Speech can be unclear <span class="toggle" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">more</span></div>
            <div class="details">
                Let's face it, not all of us are great speakers - our speech is often unclear, we swallow sounds,
                mumble, speak too quietly, some have speech defects, etc. In addition, there may be a noisy environment
                around the sender. All this makes listening very difficult.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div>3. They are not always convenient to listen to <span class="toggle"
                                                                      onclick="toggleDetails(this)">more</span></div>
            <div class="details">There are situations when listening to a voice message is impossible or difficult: the
                recipient may be watching a movie, listening to music, attending a meeting, in a noisy environment, in a
                public place without headphones, etc.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div>4. It is impossible to search through them <span class="toggle"
                                                                  onclick="toggleDetails(this)">more</span></div>
            <div class="details">There is often a need to find some information in a conversation with a person,
                especially when it is very old or just very voluminous. For example, if you agreed with a friend to meet
                somewhere, he named the place in a voice message, and you forgot. If there were many other messages, it
                becomes extremely difficult, sometimes almost impossible, to find the target one.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div>5. Listening to messages takes longer than reading <span class="toggle" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">more</span>
            </div>
            <div class="details">As a rule, we read much faster than we speak. In addition, when recording, a person
                often pauses and repeats. If listening to a voice message takes several minutes, then reading the same
                information often takes only a few seconds (depending on the speed of reading and the ability to work
                with information).
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div>6. You can't copy parts of voice messages <span class="toggle"
                                                                 onclick="toggleDetails(this)">more</span></div>
            <div class="details">Quite often, we have to not just perceive the received information, but also actively
                work with it: pass it on to someone else, search the Internet for details, etc. It is much easier to
                work with text in this case.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div>7. Text messages are more concise <span class="toggle" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">more</span></div>
            <div class="details">
                As a rule, a voice message is just a low-quality stream of thoughts, characterized by verbosity, poor
                phrasing, regular pauses, etc. In the case of a text message, there is an opportunity to re-read and
                edit it, removing unnecessary parts. In addition, when writing text, we think much better about the
                thought we want to convey.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div>8. Voice messages are heavier than text messages <span class="toggle" onclick="toggleDetails(this)">more</span>
            </div>
            <div class="details">
                If the recipient has a weak internet connection, they may have problems listening to your message: it
                may load slowly or not play at all. In addition, you may use a significant part of the recipient's
                internet traffic, which can be important in the case of roaming, etc.

            <li>When it is difficult to type: cold weather, hands are busy, etc.</li>
            <li>When it is important to convey emotions or other sounds (music, nature sounds, etc.)</li>
