# NoVoice Messages

[Russian README](README-RU.md)

**NoVoice Messages** is a web project that highlights the drawbacks of sending voice messages and encourages the use of
text messages instead. If you want to hint to the person you're talking to that you shouldn't do that, just send them
the [link](https://novoice.me/)!

## Features

- Describes why voice messages can be inconvenient
- Lists situations where voice messages are appropriate
- Clean, minimalist design

## Why NoVoice?

1. Voice messages are harder to absorb.
2. They are not always convenient to listen to.
3. Searching through voice messages is difficult.
4. Listening to messages takes longer than reading.
5. You can't copy parts of voice messages.
6. Text messages are more concise.
7. Voice messages use more data than text messages.

## When are voice messages appropriate?

- When your recipient has clearly indicated they are okay with it or sent a voice message first.
- When it is difficult to type (e.g., cold weather, hands are busy).
- When it is important to convey emotions or other sounds.
- When there are health issues (e.g., poor vision, poor motor skills).
